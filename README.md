# CV PROJECTS  

This is a repository where I made some projects implementing computer vision related tasks. Just run the main.py file to use the work. The environment as the requirements.txt file should be used to avoid any conflict.  

for all the projects, I added example video files which can be changed easily in the main file to use your own video. for the project "Poker Hand Detector", it will use webcam by default which can also be changed easily just by providing path to your video.
